### To run this program:
https://onlinegdb.com/lrSBu3iPT

### Objective:
-	Allow the user to enter the size of the dice, the number of dice to roll in a single throw, the number of throws to make.
-	Save the results of the dice rolls to a file (to allow for verification of the program).  
-	The file should have an opening header line that indicates size (number of sides) of the dice rolled. 
- Calculate the mean roll, the median roll, the standard deviation for the total number 
  of rolls made (if you wish you can store this in the files as well as showing them on the screen).

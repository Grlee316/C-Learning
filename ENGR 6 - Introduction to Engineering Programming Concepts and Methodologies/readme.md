# This Part of the repository will show the program that I wrote or modify in the class. This class incorporate both C and C++. We also use Arduino as an integral part of this class. 

## Contains:
1. Pacific Weather Program
Objective:
- reads a data file (Oceandata.txt) that contains the year, quarter, and ENSO index for that period of time. Use dynamic memory to set the size of the array at run-time.
- Determine and print to the screen the year and quarter with the strongest El Niño and La Niña conditions.
- Write to an output file named Elnino15.dat all the years and quarters and index value in which the El Nino conditions averaged stronger than 1.0 (greater than 1.0).
  The year, quarter and index are written on one line in aligned columns. Use csv standards so that the file can easily be imported into another application
- The program should read a file with monthly data. The months in the file are encoded with a number.

### Objective:
- This program will read the data provided by user in a form of text file, and then will read the amount of rows and column provided.
- It will create a two dimensional array with the size given. Then another function will be used to gather the grid data and then store it inside of the array.
- After storing the array, we then will read the value inside the array and then determine whether the value is the peak of the grid or not.
  The criteria that will be used for this function is if the value on the 4 sides of the value is lower than the selected walue itself.
